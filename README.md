Wesnap Social media Android App
This is a social media type app where users can create their profile,upload stories & send images to each other in their follower-list.So initially users have to register by entering their email id's.Then they can connect to other users using email id's & follow/unfollow them & can send images to each other.They can also upload their stories on this app & also will be able to see stories of other users who they are following.

We have implemented this system by using Android as major ,Firebase is used as Database for storage & manipulation of data,etc.
Firebase API's are used for user registration,as well as storage of images & stories of users as well.Firebase provides realtime changes in system & hence the app provides a smooth experience for user.
